You are going on a family vacation to the Galapagos Islands and need to
save some information for the trip.  In order to recall the details of the
trip later, you decide to write a ruby program that will store the information.
The program will have trip itinerary details as well as fun things from the trip
so the next time you go the Galapagos you can remember your favorite spots.

Use variables in ruby to store:

* the date you leave
* the date you return home
* the hotel name
* the number of iguanas you see
* the name of your favorite beach
* the number of giant tortoises you see

Choose a number for how many iguanas/tortoises you've seen and make
up the dates/names of the other variables. Be sure to use **expressive variable names**.

You don't have to do anything with the variables just yet. We'll use them in the next exercise.
